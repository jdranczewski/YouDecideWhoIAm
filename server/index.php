            <h1>You decide who I am</h1>
            Hi, my name is <b>Jakub Dranczewski</b> (pronounced <i>Yakoob</i>, but make the <i>oo</i> quite short). For the purposes of this Halloween party you are the one to decide who I came as!
            <br><br>
            Put anything into the text field below and it will be added to a pool of virtual 'costumes'. Every so often, my lanyard badge will select one of these randomly and <b>display it as my ID tag</b>.
            <br><br>
            It can be anything, from famous people, through references I probably won't get, to abstract concepts, adjectives, and other whatnots I could potentially be. <b>Get creative!</b>
            <br><br>
            I'll get a smartwatch notification every time a new submission comes through to my badge. If (for whatever contrived reason) you'd like to be notified too, <a href="https://t.me/YouDecideWhoIAm" target="_blank" title="The YDWIA Telegram channel">you can</a>!
            <h2>TL;DR: Put in a thing you want me to be below. My badge will randomly display it.</h2>
